## Memo

### First try
I was scared at first because I had to work with objects again, but I remembered the cool `??=` operator I just learned in Day 3 and tried to organice the shoes by size before anything else.

I know it might look bad. I am not happy with the looks of the code, I think is hard to understand at first glance.

The only think I liked about it, was the idea of having an R and I attribute in the size object defaulted at 0, so I could compare the values, so if there where 10 right shoes but 2 left shoes from the same size, I only got 2 pairs!

Adding the correct amount of pairs to the result array was fun too.

It's not a perfect score, but I am happy with it! It's honest work. üòÖ Won't try again for now since I don't have time.
